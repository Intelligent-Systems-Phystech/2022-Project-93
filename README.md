# Wildfires risk assessment using machine learning

# Abstract
The paper considers the problem of predicting extreme climatic phenomena, namely forest fires. The goal is to predict fires based on already available data on phenomena of this type using deep learning methods. It is proposed to study the time series for stationarity. Further, for short-term forecasting, stationary time series are studied in more detail. For the implementation of long-term forecasting, non-stationary time series are studied.
